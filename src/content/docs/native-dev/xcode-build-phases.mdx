Xcode builds run sequentially, in **phases**. When creating a new Xcode project following one of the built-in templates (e.g. app, framework, static library, etc.), you'll find a few of these phases to have been prepopulated (e.g. "Compile Sources" and "Copy Bundle Resources").

When creating a project using a framework such as React Native, you may notice additional phases beyond the ones those built-in templates provide. These are the secret sauce behind how the framework builds and runs!
