I've worked as a full-stack developer since 2016. Since then, I've shipped both web and native apps to iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Smart TVs. I've also built backends on baremetal Linux servers involving lots of Docker and Node.js. Along the way, I've abandoned over 200 [side-projects](https://github.com/shirakaba?tab=repositories).

Given the large surface area I've been exposed to over the years, I felt that it's about time I wrote down some of the things I've learned to pass that knowledge along.

So, welcome to my compendium!
